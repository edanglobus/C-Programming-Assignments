# C-Programming-Assignments
Welcome to my C Programming Assignments Repository! This repository contains several projects  I completed as part of my studies in C programming. Each project focuses on key programming concepts and demonstrates my understanding of various data structures and algorithms.

## Projects

1. **Pointers**  
   This project explores the concept of pointers in C, including pointer arithmetic and dynamic memory allocation.

2. **Dynamic Arrays**  
   In this project, I implemented dynamic arrays to showcase how to manage memory allocation and resizing of arrays in C.

3. **Lists**  
   This project focuses on implementation linked lists, including operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

4. **Binary Trees** 
   implemented binary trees, demonstrating traversal techniques such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

5. **Working with Files**  
   This project covers file handling in C, including reading from and writing to files, as well as basic file operations.

6. **Knight's Tour**  
   The final project tackles the Knight's Tour problem in chess, implementing a solution that allows the knight to visit every square on the board exactly once.
